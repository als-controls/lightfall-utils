"""Stop caproto's user-callback thread pools cleanly at application shutdown.

Each connected caproto virtual circuit owns a *non-daemon*
``ThreadPoolExecutor`` (``user_callback_executor``) that runs user
subscription/read/write callbacks. ``concurrent.futures`` registers an
``atexit`` hook that joins every executor's worker threads at interpreter
shutdown, so a callback still in flight there stalls exit -- the reason
host applications may install a force-exit watchdog. Draining these
executors (without tearing down sockets) lets the process exit on its own.

``get_caproto_context`` never *creates* a context: at shutdown we only want
the one caproto already built, not a fresh one (which would spawn threads).
